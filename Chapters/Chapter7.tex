\chapter{Future Goals}

Looking ahead, there are two primary objectives for future work:

\section{Further Acceleration of the Model}
The first goal is to further improve the speed of the model. Currently, our model achieves a 100x speedup compared to Geant4 simulations. However, there is potential for even greater acceleration by exploring alternative methods. For instance, replacing the Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) framework with an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) approach, or implementing a restart method as suggested in \cite{restart}, could lead to significant improvements in computational efficiency.

\section{Layer Relationship Learning and Tracking}
The second goal is to enhance the model's ability to learn the relationships between layers. Specifically, we aim to train the model to identify which hits in one layer correspond to hits in the previous layer. This capability would enable the development of a model for particle tracking, providing a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of the underlying physical processes.

Achieving these goals would not only improve the current model but also open new possibilities for its application in simulation and analysis.
