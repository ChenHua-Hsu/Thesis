abstract = {The PhaseÂ 1 upgrade of the CMS Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) involved the installation of new silicon photomultiplier devices (SiPMs), which replaced older hybrid photodiodes (HPDs). SiPMs measure the scintillator light output with better signal/noise. The upgraded readout electronics also allow for increased longitudinal segmentation and better performance. This report describes the design, testing, installation, and commissioning of the HCAL Barrel Phase 1 upgrade. Performance results for the HCAL Endcap during Run 2 are presented and expectations for the HCAL Barrel during Run 3 are discussed.}
