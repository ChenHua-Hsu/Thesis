Dear Prof. [Last Name],

My name is Tong Wu, and I am currently a Master's student at NTU. Under the guidance of Professor Yee Bob Hsiung, I am writing my thesis on the topic of "Search for a massless dark photon in KL0 → γγ* at the KOTO Experiment". As I am approaching the oral defense phase of my research, Professor Hsiung has spoken highly of you and recommended that I invite you to be a member of my defense committee.

We have scheduled the defense to take place at NTU, with potential dates being July 30 and July 31. (Bcause the progress of my thesis, and ICHEP period) I would be immensely honored if you could join us as an examiner. Could you please let me know if you are available on either of these dates? If these do not fit your schedule, I would appreciate it if you could inform me of any alternative dates that might be convenient for you.

Thank you very much for considering this invitation. Your participation would greatly enrich my defense, and I look forward to potentially benefiting from your expertise.

Subject: Confirmation and Preliminary Details for My Thesis Defense

Hi everyone,

I'm thrilled to let you know that all of you have confirmed your participation in my thesis defense—thank you! It's incredibly encouraging to have your support and expertise as I reach this important milestone.

Here’s what we know so far:

Date: July 30
Time: 3 PM (Taipei Time) / 9 AM (CERN Time)
Location: To be determined within NTU (details to follow)
Whether you'll be joining us in person or virtually, I'm looking forward to a dynamic session with insightful discussions from each of you. I’ll make sure that both our on-site and remote setups are seamless so that everyone can engage effectively.

About two weeks before the defense, I'll send another email with the exact room location at NTU, detailed access instructions for our remote attendees, and a copy of my final draft thesis for your review.

If there's anything you need or would like to discuss in the meantime, please feel free to reach out. I’m eager to share my work with you and hear your thoughts!

Thanks once again for your commitment, and see you on July 30th!

Best,
